Zealthy Exercise
1- Create a QA testing process document that describes in detail what you would suggest for a team of 6 engineers and that would be used until the engineering team became 30 engineers. This should not be a QA process designed for large engineering teams of larger than 30. This process documentation should include how QA testing occurs including frequency, environment, and paths tested. It should reflect what testing is done manually and what testing is automated. It should also note how engineers will be engaged in the process and how the overall Zealthy team will improve code quality.

QA TESTING PROCESS DOCUMENT FOR ZEALTHY ENGINEERING TEAM 
•	Introduction: This document outlines the QA testing process designed for the Zealthy engineering team. The process focuses on ensuring code quality, identifying defects, and fostering collaboration between QA and engineering team. 
•	Team Composition: Initially, the QA team consist of 1 dedicated QA Engineer. With the team's growth, additional QA resources will be added to maintain an appropriate QA- to- engineer ratio, ensuring effective testing coverage.
•	Testing Approach; 
o	Manuel Testing : Initially, most testing will be done manually by the QA Engineer. This includes functional testing and regression testing, and exploratory testing. This reduces the reliance on manuel testing as the primary means of bug discovery. 
o	Automated Testing : As the team grows, a shift towards automation will be introduced. Automation test will be developed for regression testing, and smoke testing. This ensures quicker feedback on changes and reduces the risk of regressions.
•	Test Frequency ;
o	Daily Smoke Testing : The QA Engineer will perfom daily smoke test to ensure crucial part of application, and perfom daily tests on new builds to identify regressions or critical issues promptly.
o	Continuous Testing : Engineers will integrate testing into their development workflow, conducting thorough testing before pushing code to production. Formal QA sessions will still occur twice per week, but they will be supplemented by ongoing automated and manuel testing efforts.
o	Release (Regression)Testing : Before each release, comprehensive regression testing will be conducted to ensure the stability of the product.
•	Environment ; 
o	Development and Staging Environments : Testing will be conducted in development and staging environments to catch issues earlier in the development lifecycle before they reach production.
•	Engineering Engagement ;
o	Bug Reporting : Engineers are responsible for reporting any bugs encountered during development or testing.
o	Collaborative Testing : QA Engineers and developers will collaborate closely during development cycles. Engineers will participate in testing their own code and reviewing test plans to ensure comprehensive coverage.
o	Feedback Loop : Establish a feedback loop between QA and engineering teams to address issues efficiently and improve communication. 
•	Code Quality Improvement ;
o	Iterative Code Reviews : Codes reviews by the engineering lead will remain a crucial aspect of the proces to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices. QA engineers will participate in code reviews to provide input on testability and identify potential issues early on.
o	Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) : Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate code integration, testing, and deployment process. This ensures that code changes are thoroughly tested and deployed rapidly, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into production.
•	Scaling Up; 
o	Hiring Plan : As the engineering team grows, additional QA resources will be hired to maintain an effective QA-to-Engineer ratio.
o	Process Optimization : Continuously evaluate and optimize the QA proceess to accommodate the growing team size and evolving project requirements.
o	Training and Onboarding : Provide training and onboarding for new QA hires to ensure alignment with the established QA processes and standarts.
•	Conclusion ; This QA testing process document serves as a roadmap for ensuring code quality, defect identification, and collaboration within tthe Zealthy engineering team. By expanding automated testing efforts, optimizing manual testing procedures, and fostering collaboration between engineers and product management, the team can deliver high quality software products that meet user needs and exceed expectations.
